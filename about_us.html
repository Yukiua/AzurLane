  <br>
    My name is Aqil Rifaie. Born on the 18th February of 2003, I share half my blood with Singapore and Malaysia.
    My paternal family hailed from Singapore while my maternal family hailed from Selangor, Malaysia.
    I am the third of four siblings. My father sadly passed away in February of 2017, leaving us with a disabled aunt, which is his younger sister.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    My hobbies are playing games and reading light novels, albeit all of them are common in being Japanese-related.
    I mostly play mobile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game" alt="Gacha Wiki">gacha</a> games, such as <a href="https://fate-go.us">Fate/Grand Order</a> and <a href="https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Azur_Lane_Wiki">Azur Lane</a>.
    Some of my favourite <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/">light novels</a> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandering_Witch:_The_Journey_of_Elaina">Wandering Witch Elaina</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushoku_Tensei">Mushoku Tensei</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arifureta:_From_Commonplace_to_World%27s_Strongest">Arifureta:From Commonplace to World's Strongest</a>.
    My all-time youtube watchtime is mostly dedicated to <a href="https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Hololive">Hololive Virtual Youtubers</a>, especially <a href="https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Minato_Aqua">Minato Aqua</a>.

    I studied at Evergreen Primary School, due to closeness in proximity.
    I graduated EGPS with a T-Score of 186, in which I chose to enrol in Naval Base Secondary School.
    As I did not have enough T-Score to be enrolled in the Express course, I was forced to enrol in the Normal(Academic) course.
    I picked the  InfoComm CCA as I had interest in programming.
    At the end of Secondary 2, I was given the option to be laterally transferred to the Express course, due to my excellent conduct and grades.
    I proceeded on to take the GCE 'O' Level, in which I obtained an L1R4 of 17.
    Luckily, I successfully applied to Nanyang Polytechnic in the Diploma in Infomation Technology via the Early Admission Exercise beforehand.
    Therefore, I enrolled to Nanyang Polytechnic as soon as the 'O' level results were released as I had already claimed a spot in the course.

    <br>

    <br>
    I am usually quiet and introverted, but will speak out if I have any concerns or something of utmost importance that needs be clarified or conveyed.
    This made me more of an observer and a thinker.
    Observing people while walking became somewhat of an interest.
    Some people would walk while playing their phones.
    Some would wear unbelievably thick clothing in this hot and humid weather.
    A very interesting trend I observed was how little people cared for their surroundings when they are walking.
    This is what the 'kiasu' culture in Singapore had resulted in.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    My personality made me unable to make many friends in school, as I would always have anxiety when approaching someone who would become my friend.
    I was able to make acquaintances, who would later become my closest friends, due to group fixings by teachers for some group projects.
    As shown in the picture on the left, these aquaintances would shape me to be more open, talkative and expressive in my opinions, to the point where sacarsms would be thrown left and right in our conversations.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    I am always appreciative and thankful to my friends who made me able to take up the decision to pursue tertiary education in Polytechnic, instead of Junior College, as they are familiar with my strengths and weaknesses.

    My strength is that I am able to rationally and logically think of a solution that is seemingly effective and swift.
    This made my best subjects in school to be Math and Science, as it requires more of logic than language.
    On the other hand, I am very terrible in language-based subjects like English or Social Studies, as it requires more of an open-minded thinking and creativity, which I lackluster in.
    In addition, I am very bad in stressed situations, in which I am unable to think logically and rationally.
    To cover the weakness, I would jump into meditation to calm myself to allow my mind to be clear.
